# Long Term Plans

## Path to Adoption

Our strategy focuses on:

1. **Validation through Practice**: Pilot tournaments and parallel scoring demonstrations
2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Early consultation with officials from all major organizations
3. **Gradual Implementation**: Allowing organizations to adopt at their own pace
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Addressing specific concerns of each Go tradition
5. **Technical Support**: Ensuring software and training materials are ready

## Next Steps

We would be honored to receive:

- **Thoughtful feedback** from Go organizations and officials
- **Opportunities** to demonstrate these ideas in friendly settings
- **Guidance** from respected players and officials
- **Scholarly review** from academic and technical experts

## How You Can Help

We believe the best ideas emerge through community collaboration.
Whether you're a player, official, or simply someone who loves Go, your perspective matters.
The technical details are in the PDF, but the real work is building understanding and consensus within our community.
