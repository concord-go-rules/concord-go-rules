# Concord Rules of Go

Concord Rules combine the best features of Japanese/Korean, Chinese, AGA and Taiwan rules.
They achieve these three important goals:

- *Every point matters.* Small endgame mistakes can alter the final score by a single point. (Similar to Japanese/Korean rules, unlike AGA and Chinese rules.)
- *Both territory and area counting work.* Both methods always give the same score. (Similar to AGA rules, unlike Chinese and Japanese/Korean rules.)
- *Just Play It Out.* Games can always continue until all dead stones are captured without changing the score. (Similar to Chinese and AGA rules, unlike Japanese/Korean rules.)

In particular they achieve rare combination of ability to combine territory counting and Just Play It Out.
