# Concord Go Rules

Concord Go Rules combine the best features of Japanese/Korean, Chinese, AGA and Taiwan rules.
They achieve these important goals:

- *Every point matters.* Small endgame mistakes can alter the final score by a single point. <br>
- *Both territory and area counting work.* Both methods always give the same score. <br>
- *Resolution by Play.* Games can continue until all dead stones are captured (without changing the score). <br>

| Every Point Matters       |         ✅          |     ❌    |  ❌   |      ✅     |
| Resolution by Play        |         ❌          |     ✅    |  ✅   |      ✅     |
| Game Ends with Two Passes |         ✅          |     ✅    |  ❌   |      ✅     |

In particular, Concord Go Rules achieve the rare combination of territory counting and Resolution by Play.
