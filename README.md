# Concord Rules of Go

## An Aspiration Toward Unified Go Rules

The Concord Rules of Go explore the possibility of greater harmony between different Go rule systems used by organizations worldwide.
This proposal respectfully examines how the rich traditions of major Go organizations might find common ground.
These include the Nihon Ki-in, Kansai Ki-in, Chinese Weiqi Association, Korean Baduk Association, Taiwan Qixi Association, European Go Federation (EGF), American Go Association (AGA), and others.

### Why This Matters

Go organizations worldwide use slightly different rule systems, each with their own strengths.
These differences create confusion for players and complications for international competition.
Current rule systems also leave beginners puzzled by special cases and create challenges for Go engines that need precise mathematical rules.

The Concord Rules explore whether these systems might be harmonized while serving everyone from newcomers to AI researchers.

### What We Hope to Offer

- **Respect for Tradition**: Built upon the wisdom of existing rule systems, honoring their contributions
- **Potential for Clarity**: May help reduce disputes about life and death or scoring methods
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Offers proven equivalence between counting methods
- **Gentle Approach**: Explores only minimal modifications (pass stones and last pass rule)

### Current Status

This is a **humble proposal and working document** intended to spark thoughtful discussion within the Go community. We hope this exploration might be:

- **Respectful**: Honoring all traditional approaches to the game we love
- **Accessible**: Easy to understand and consider
- **Optimal Design**: Designed to be the best possible rules for achieving all stated goals 

### Getting Started

**[ðŸ“„ View the Complete PDF Rules](https://github.com/lukaszlew/concord-go-rules/blob/main/Concord%20Go%20Rules.pdf)**

To build the PDF documentation locally:
```bash
latex/make_pdf.sh
```

The PDF contains:
- Complete rule specifications
- Detailed comparisons with existing systems
- Mathematical proofs of scoring equivalence

### Key Insight

The proposal centers on two simple modifications (pass stone and last pass rules) that could unify different counting methods while respecting existing traditions.
Concord Rules achieve high 1-point resolution scoring while avoiding tactical complications like pass fights.

### Path to Adoption

Our strategy focuses on:

1. **Validation through Practice**: Pilot tournaments and parallel scoring demonstrations
2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Early consultation with officials from all major organizations
3. **Gradual Implementation**: Allowing organizations to adopt at their own pace
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Addressing specific concerns of each Go tradition
5. **Technical Support**: Ensuring software and training materials are ready

### Next Steps

We would be honored to receive:

- **Thoughtful feedback** from Go organizations and officials
- **Opportunities** to demonstrate these ideas in friendly settings
- **Guidance** from respected players and officials
- **Scholarly review** from academic and technical experts

### Contributing

This project welcomes input from:
- Go organization officials and rule committee members
- Professional and strong amateur players
- Tournament directors and referees
- Go software developers
- Academic researchers in game theory

### Our Hope

We do not seek to impose change, but simply to offer ideas that might benefit the Go community:

- **Players** might enjoy more consistent experiences across different venues
- **Organizations** could preserve their cherished traditions while potentially gaining technical advantages
- **The Go Community** might experience reduced controversy and greater clarity
- **International Competition** could become more harmonized over time

### Community Benefits

This project aims to serve everyone in the Go community:
- **Players** could enjoy more consistent experiences across different venues
- **Teachers and Students** would have clearer rules without confusing edge cases
- **Tournament Organizers** might experience fewer rule disputes
- **Software Developers** could implement precise, unambiguous rules
- **International Competition** could become more harmonized

### How You Can Help

We believe the best ideas emerge through community collaboration.
Whether you're a player, official, or simply someone who loves Go, your perspective matters.
The technical details are in the PDF, but the real work is building understanding and consensus within our community.
