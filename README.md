### How to Play Go with Concord Rules?

- **When passing, place a pass stone in your opponent's prisoner bowl.** This gives the opponent one point, but since games typically end with two passes, this does not change the result.
- **The first and last pass must be made by different players.**
- **Count every surrounded point as territory, even in seki.** Seki (mutual life positions) eyes are points.
- **When scoring is unclear, continue playing until all dead stones are captured.** This does not change the game's final score.

### Why Concord Rules?

Concord Rules combine the best features of Japanese/Korean, Chinese, AGA and Taiwan rules.

| Feature                   | Japanese /<br>Korean |  Chinese  |  AGA  | Taiwan | **Concord** |
|---------------------------|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----:|:------:|:-----------:|
| Territory Scoring        |         ✅           |     ❌    |  ✅   |   ❌   |      ✅     |
| Area Scoring             |         ❌           |     ✅    |  ✅   |   ✅   |      ✅     |
| Every Point Counts        |         ✅           |     ❌    |  ❌   |   ✅   |      ✅     |
| Play Settles Disputes     |         ❌           |     ✅    |  ✅   |   ✅   |      ✅     |
| Game Ends with Two Passes |         ✅           |     ✅    |  ❌   |   ✅   |      ✅     |

Concord Rules achieve these important goals:

- *Both territory and area scoring work.* Both methods always give the same score.
- *Every point counts.* The rules preserve single-point precision in final scores, capturing skill differences that 2-point Chinese and AGA scoring might miss.
- *Play Settles Disputes.* When life and death is unclear, simply capture all the dead stones - the final score remains unchanged.
