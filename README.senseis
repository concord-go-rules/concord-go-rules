== How to Play Go with Concord Go Rules? ==

* __When passing, place a pass stone in your opponent's prisoner bowl.__ This gives the opponent one point, but since games typically end with two passes, this does not change the result.
* __The first and last pass must be made by different players.__
* __Count every surrounded point as territory, even in seki.__ Seki (mutual life positions) eyes are points.
* __When scoring is unclear, continue playing until all dead stones are captured.__ This does not change the game's final score.

== Why Concord Go Rules? ==

Concord Go Rules combine the best features of Japanese/Korean, Chinese, AGA and Taiwan rules.

Concord Go Rules achieve these important goals:

* __Both territory and area counting work.__ Both methods always give the same score.
* __Every point matters.__ Small endgame mistakes can alter the final score by a single point.
* __Resolution by Play.__ Games can continue until all dead stones are captured.
